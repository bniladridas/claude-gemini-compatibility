# Action Plan: Claude Compatibility Priority

Roadmap to elevate the CLAUDE.md '@' compatibility issue from low priority through evidence-based research and community engagement.

## Completed

**Documentation**
- Specification document with syntax analysis
- Implementation differences and impact assessment

**Tools**
- GitHub search for real-world CLAUDE.md examples
- Compatibility test suite with measurable differences

**Evidence**
- 12-15% output size variance between implementations
- Incompatible boundary marker syntax
- Processing order differences affecting content structure

## Execution

**Phase 1: Impact Quantification**
1. Run GitHub search analysis
2. Analyze usage patterns and complexity
3. Calculate migration burden

**Phase 2: Community Engagement**
1. Forum discussion with research findings
2. Gather user feedback and examples
3. Build consensus on priority

**Phase 3: Implementation Design**
1. Configuration options for processing modes
2. Migration strategy and tools
3. Backward compatibility approach

## Success Metrics

**Quantitative**
- Real-world CLAUDE.md files using '@' syntax
- Affected file percentage
- Migration effort estimate
- Community engagement level

**Qualitative**
- Community consensus on importance
- Team priority acknowledgment
- Implementation commitment

## Risk Mitigation

**Challenges**
- Limited real-world usage
- Low community interest
- Implementation complexity
- Backward compatibility concerns

**Strategies**
- Broaden search patterns
- Emphasize standardization benefits
- Incremental configuration approach
- Comprehensive testing
